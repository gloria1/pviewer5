remove (or comment out) facility to view packets excluded via quickfilter
	separate datagrid
	qfexcluded packet set in mainwindow
	logic in file read method that puts an "excluded" packet into separate packet set


handle ipv4 "options" field


quickfilters
	test performance - if too slow, try optimizing by
		ordering filters
		structuring into dictionaries (one dict for each mask value) using comparevalue as the key

	maybe also add other criteria, like ether type/len field (to exclude ipv6 noise, for example)

	dialog improvements
		checkboxes to toggle aliasing of mac/ip addresses
		drag and drop
		add/delete row respect multi selections
